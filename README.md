# Page about rabbits
This page is about rabbits. But this is not as important as what this site was created for. The main task was about responsible layout: what is it, how does it work and how to implement it in website. I took this task from lesson about responsible layout on LinkedIn Learning.
On mobile devices and devices with max width of 750px element "More Rabbits" moves to the end of the page.
